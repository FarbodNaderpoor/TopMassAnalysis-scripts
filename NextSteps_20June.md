#### Next Steps (June 20, 2022) 
##### Looking at Muon properties
* Several properties of reconstructed muons are plotted and different selection cuts are applied
   * Try to understand the meaning of any of these variables. 
   * Check how identification variables (such as isGlobal, nTrackerLayers etc.) change after requiring a tightId working point.
* Look at the pt distribution. How many entries is there? You should be able to explain where it comes from.
* After applying all muon selection cuts, we count good muons.
   * To check how well we were able to identify muons, compare the distributions of nMus vs nGoodRecMus. 
      * What would be your conclusion? 
      * Another important measure we can use is DeltaR (in eta/phi space). So we can check whether any generated muon exists close enough to the good selected muon. 
         * Think about making such a plot.  
      * In addition to the multiplicity plot, you can look at other properties such as pt. 
         * Make the pt distribution of good selected muon and compare it with the pt of generated muon.
